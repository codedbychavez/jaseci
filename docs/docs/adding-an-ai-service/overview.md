# Overview

Jaseci does not limit developer creativity into using its pre-made AI services but it gives developers the flexibility to develop and configure their own AI services that leverages the jaseci engine to make the services they develop available to others through a stable and secure production ready environment.

In this section of the docs we'll explore step by step how this can be done. By the end of this section you'll be confident and ready to develop your own AI services.

Jaseci AI services are regular HTTP services that provide some machine learning / AI functionality via API endpoints.
